## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

On the landing page, I’ve included a download button so you can easily get a copy of my CV. 

I’ve added my profile picture to the "About Me" section, where you'll find a short summary about me and my journey. Further down the page, in the "Contacts" section, there’s a contact form for getting in touch. I've also intentionally placed the social media icons in the footer of the page near the Contacts to demonstrate various other ways to get in contact with me and view my profile. 
​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

I’ve decided to put the “About Me” section on the second page of my portfolio. To make updates safely, I created a separate development branch called "first branch," which lets me experiment and make changes without risking anything on the main version. When the changes were what I was happy with I merged the changes into main.

I’ve applied responsive design principles to my portfolio, like setting a maximum width for images and using media queries to adjust layouts for the different screen sizes being viewed by my portfolio (mobile and desktop). Plus, I’ve used HTML semantics to clearly define the various parts of my portfolio, such as sections for the different topics aka About, Projects and Contact. I've utilised articles categorise my different projects, the header for the tabs on top and footers with my social media icons linking to my profile. 

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)

- In the nav page, when you hover over the nav options you see the cursor change into hand.
- When you hover over the article portion of my Projects, the effects of the contrast is raised.
-  When hovering over the Download CV button, a shadow effect appears under the button.
